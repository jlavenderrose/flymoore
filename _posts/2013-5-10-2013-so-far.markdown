What a surprise! I didn't update this website very often for a long time. Again! I've been busy being a ridiculously involved college student with his hands in almost every theatrical production he can possibly work on. Accordingly my photographic output has also been just a 'tiny' little bit less prolific than in years past.

Because of that, here's a summary of the last 5 months of my life in a little photo essay.

	Flying to Worcester
{% endflickrimg %}

On January 2nd I packed up my bags and put all the thoughts from the long semester previous behind me. I headed back out to Worcester to work on a musical being put on at WPI by the student run Vox. We put on <i>I Love You Because</i> and it was truly wonderful experience and one I'm not going to forget anytime soon.

I did not however, love the cold. This is already several weeks later in the after math of Winter Storm Nemo. When I flew into Worcester on that cold January Day it was a whole 2 degrees fahrenheit. It didn't stay that cold forever but it was icy and snowy and awful for way longer than is reasonable for a native Californian.

I did like taking pictures of things covered in snow though, apparently. (Apparently also [apparently](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jreedmoore/8524045273/in/photostream/lightbox/) [snow](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jreedmoore/8524046833/in/photostream/lightbox/) [in](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jreedmoore/8525162756/in/photostream/lightbox/) [general](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jreedmoore/8525164398/in/photostream/lightbox/))

	Frosty Window

A testament to how busy I was this last semester, this is the last good photo I have from before I got home. It's a picture of an airplane window on my flight home.

And now I'm home. I expect I'm going to spend all summer taking photos and making big plans for next year and next to none of them will actually happen.

(But hey at least I fixed this website in some limited sense and am actually doing stuff, if only for the next three months).
