title: New Chair

For those of you not in the know, we got a new chair at the Moore household recently. It came for free from our generous neighbor, and finally fills out the seating arrangement in our living room. Finally after some 15 years of living here we can all sit down around the TV at once (not that we ever will of course).

We quickly discovered that as much as we like the chair (it really is comfortable) the cats, who probably have immeasurably more time with which to enjoy it, also like it quite a bit.

A forceful takeover...

It turns out that this chair is a [POÄNG](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S19805433/), a chair from Ikea. I found this out because I had these photos up on my screen during a Study Hall period at school, and one of my friends walked by and happened to glance at the pictures. Somehow in less than about 10 seconds she was able to figure out that this was in fact a POÄNG (although didn't know the spelling so my first search was for a "Pawang")

It turns out that this chair renders cats rather immobile, so you can hover over them all day with a camera and they will lazily submit. This seem like the complete opposite of the way cats usually react to cameras, which is to start moving around as much as possible so as to make your 1/30th of a second shutter speed completely useless.

Lazy cats...

I actually took pictures spanning over multiple days of cats on this chair, and they started to get progressively more "artsy"

The "Artsy" nature of this is lost when you find out this cat's name is 'Tails.'
