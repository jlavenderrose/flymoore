So here's a thing that I am doing at this moment. [http://flymoore.com/tabularasa/0001.html](/tabularasa/0001.html)

It doesn't really have a name, but if I had to call it something I'd call it "Tabula Rasa". I don't really want to talk terribly much about what I'm planning to do with this, but the name and first page should make it abundantly clear where this is headed.

I do hope I can actually craft a compelling story out of the elements that I'm going to have to work with here.
