title: Waffle Ride Sandwiches
---
It all starts with a dream (actually the product of being hungry).

Being an endurance road cyclist I spend a lot of time on my bike. To avoid the dreaded "bonk" I have to eat ridiculous amounts of food. Burning upwards of 3.5k calories on a typical long ride that energy can't all come from energy drinks. Nor can it come from energy bars (Clif Bars or Powerbars and the like) because they just get too boring. By the 4th Clif Bar of the day you just want to stop eating.

So I got [The Feed Zone Cookbook](http://velopress.competitor.com/nutrition.php?id=321) for Christmas, and I've tried a couple recipes from it. Like: _Waffle Ride Sandwiches_.

	The most important ingredient, rice, lined up and ready to go.

	After being cooked the rice is blended with the rest of the ingredients which makes this terrifying slurry.

After this point the process always turns into pure frustration as this incredibly weird rice-based waffle batter has to be cooked on our waffle iron. Which is lack-luster to say the least. I've found that the best method for getting these to come out well is to pour the batter out, making sure it covers the whole waffle maker, and then go do something else for about 25 minutes while it cooks...

	All the effort pays off the next day though, when I pull waffles out of the freezer, pop them in the toaster, and slather them with all kinds of delicious goodies. Here peanut butter and honey.

	After coating the waffles in goodness I slice them up so I can stuff them in a ziplock bag and eat them on the go.

It might look weird, but at mile 57 it's good stuff.
