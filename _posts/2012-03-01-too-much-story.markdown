title: Too Much Story Not Enough Art
author: Julian R. Moore
---
I seem to post in spurts on this website. I suppose that's alright in its own way, I'd rather post more frequently. Part of my problem is that I'm beat-tired most days, but most of my problem is that I try too hard. I have to have some kind of coherent story holding my post together, and that is sometimes quite difficult to figure out. I don't do a whole lot of coherent story photography sessions, so I have a lot of very disjointed art.

So now, Project: "Post some pictures, with some frequency." begins.

What is it? Can you figure it out?

How about now?

Or how about this? (Don't even think about clicking on the image to see the description that's cheating.)

I have no standards.
