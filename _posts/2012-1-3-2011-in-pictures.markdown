title: 2011 in Pictures
---
The new year has begun and college applications are creeping up on me, so I've decided to shamelessly steal someone else's ideas. Inspired by [this guy](http://janneinosaka.blogspot.com/2008/01/2007-pictures.html) who was himself inspired by [this other guy](http://shisaku.blogspot.com/2007/12/one-more-year-then-2007.html) I'm going to post a picture for every month of the year.

Sort of.

I don't have pictures going back before March of this year (I don't even know what computer I would have been using at that point) and there was one month (August) where I had nothing that I could post on the wild wild internet without fear of it going badly. So this is really "12 pictures that are sort of vaguely grouped by month."

Enjoy!

### January
Nothing to see here...

</div>
###### Some dangerous-looking props for a school project in another class. It was all styled after Angry Birds (and taught freshman kinematics, oh joy!)

</div>
###### This is from the FIRST Robotics Competition Regional in Los Angeles this year. The main cause for excitement here is that overly agressive Human Player throwing an inner-tube. It all looks silly but I assure you it's very serious stuff.

### April

</div>
###### I worked at my school doing "network infrastructure upgrades" over the summer which really meant playing around with laptops on top of ladders for a couple months.

### July

</div>
###### Same as above but remarkably different in appearance.

### August
I guess my enthusiasm dwindled here...

### September
<div class="flickr">
	<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/65203238@N04/6631638407/" title="Sleeping Beauty by jreedmoore, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7026/6631638407_a985dab02f.jpg" width="500" alt="Sleeping Beauty"></a>

### October

</div>
###### I'm known to partake in racing from time to time, and this is the sad truth of it. Get up at 5:30 AM to throw your bike in the back of your car and drive out to some industrial park for a 45 minute race. All very unglamorous.

### November

</div>
###### Same as above, only this time the cat decided to sleep on our Christmas Tree star...

### This coming year.
I hadn't expected this to be the case but I suppose one of my New Years Resolutions ought to be to keep up with my photography. I think my habit of carrying my camera with me everywhere I go will likely come back. Then instead of the current disheartening state of things where I have nearly one and half thousand pictures for a few months and only 400 are even immediately acceptable, I'll have thousands upon thousands of them and the quality will be even lower.
