A few days ago I ambled along to the [Van Nuys Sherman Oaks 'Recreation Center'](http://goo.gl/maps/MS3F), a big park with a pool and an inordinate amount of space for little kids to play little league (insert-sport-here). I've just recently gotten a new camera, and I haven't really gotten into the swing of doing photo walks and taking pictures that aren't horrible so I figured I'd try my hand once more. 

I ended up taking 194 photos, and I think I posted 8 to [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jreedmoore/). So I guess that was reasonably successful. Here's a few of them:

{% flickrimg {{ page.image.door }} %}
	There are a bunch of homes bordering the park and a bunch of them have little gates to give them their own 'private' access to the park. I guess these people don't use theirs very often though.
{% endflickrimg %}

{% flickrimg  {{ page.image.leaf }} %}
	Here's a generic photographer's shot. This was right next to the door above.
{% endflickrimg %}

{% flickrimg  {{ page.image.bee }} %}
	I started taking pictures of these weird flowers, but I ended up being way more interested in the bees flying around. They seem to get stuck in these flowers for awhile, I assume because they are rather a tight fit for a bee.
{% endflickrimg %}

"These weird flowers" turned out to be [Kangaroo Paw](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo_paw), maybe specifically [Anigozanthos flavidus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anigozanthos_flavidus) although I'm really not sure if it's that particular species.

	And as with any scene in the Greater Los Angeles area, here's some urban decay.
