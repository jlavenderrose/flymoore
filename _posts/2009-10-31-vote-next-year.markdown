title: Tell your parents to vote there'll be more candy next year.
author: Julian R. Moore

Beyond this year’s excuse for only giving out one candy bar per trickertreater (is there a standard unit for this?) of note was the costumes, or lack thereof this year. A very popular ‘costume’ seemed to be a backpack, a skateboard, and a cellphone. “Wait sorry I’m too busy to get off my phone to get candy from you.”

Was a fun night.
