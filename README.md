# This is flymoore.com

This is essentially a github backup of the source for the [jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) powered website I run at (flymoore.com)[http://flymoore.com/]. It would be feasible for me to manage development here and use my own repository only for the master branch (which on update gets processed into the live website), effectively reversing the current system. I don't really see any benefit to this though, as it would only show more of my poor design decisions to the world and I don't expect much collaboration on this.

Anyway, there isn't much exciting to see here, there's lots of very bad and poorly documented code and that's about it.
