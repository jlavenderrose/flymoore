As TIME begins events begin to unfold quickly. The DRAGONS and SPIDERS begin fighting to gain control of the LASAGNA. Slowly both sides are able to steal away with small amounts of the LASAGNA, and as it does not restore itself eventually all of the LASAGNA disappears.

With no LASAGNA left to fight over the DRAGONS and SPIDERS become desperate, they not only have no food to consume, (it is unclear whether they actually need food to survive) but they now they have nothing to live for. The DRAGONS and SPIDERS disperse from the former site of the LASAGNA and begin to congregate around the various GUMPS in THE ENDLESS VOID.

There must be some significance to the GUMPS because the DRAGONS and SPIDERS are taking notice of them, and some of them have begun to grow larger, and others begun to look rather sickly.

As all this happens no intervention has been made in THE ENDLESS VOID because there exists no mechanism for this to happen.

What shall "YOU" be?
