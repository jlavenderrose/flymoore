The DRAGONS begin to close in. They circle around your treasured GUMP and all the SPIDERS tense their HYDRAULIC LEGS\*. One by one the DRAGONS land on GUMPS around the GUMP you have worked so hard to cultivate. They all land out of reach, except for the largest DRAGON.

"WILL YOU NOT END YOUR TRANSGRESSIONS?"

"WILL YOU NOT STOP ENDANGERING THIS WORLD?"

The SPIDERS have no real leaders, nor vocal chords, so there is no response.

"THE TRANSFORMATION OF THIS gump IS NIGH UPON US."

"YOU ARE THREATENING EVERYTHING IN THIS REALM BY ALLOWING THIS TO HAPPEN."

"WE CANNOT, AS RESPONSIBLE dragons ALLOW THIS TO OCCUR, WE MUST DESTROY THIS gump."

Once again, the SPIDERS say nothing.

The DRAGON's leader rises up, and with a single beat of his massive wings flies over the GUMP, and begins to belch a breath of fire.

What will you do?
