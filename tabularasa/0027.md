[>stop being the chocolate](0026.html)

You try to stop being the chocolate. Neil doesn't know what this means, but you can't stop being the chocolate anyway! Instead, you stop being Neil.

The world that Neil inhabited and the space surrounding it is still all that is observable. THE ENDLESS VOID is out of view at this time. The reason is unclear.
