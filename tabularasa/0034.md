[>try to talk to Neil](0034.html)

You should really try to talk to this guy, you think the tension between you two is upsetting Ruby...

"Hey Neil, how goes it?"

"How goes it? You know, we're going to what does amount to a frozen wasteland and everyone is sort of blaming me for it?"

"We're blaming you for it?"

"Yeah I figure the whole outburst during that meeting, and being called last is making it seem like my fault. Of course I'm sure the Empire would say it's all part of 'The Bigger Picture'."

"Haha yeah I'm sure they'd say that. I was wondering what you think of the assignment though."

"I think it's gonna be great for me at least. I get to study the heavens under a distinguished Professor. But yeah I worry about what you guys are going to do..."

"Yeah... I don't really want to become a vampire, or die of frostbite or something."

"Well again the Icebats... well I guess it doesn't matter."

"Not so much, I'm expecting it to be a very droll experience honestly. I can't imagine how anything interesting will happen up so far North."

Eva, who could hear your conversation from the common room interjected, "have you ever seen the Northern Lights?"

"The Northern what?"
