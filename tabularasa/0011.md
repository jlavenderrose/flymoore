You rise out of your comfy web, stretch your legs, and start climbing down to the LASAGNA PILE. On your way you run into other spiders. You greet everyone with "Ey, Chnida." Everyone greets you with, "Ey, Chnida." You grab your piece of LASAGNA, take it to the GUMP you're cultivating and climb inside it's skull through its EAR. The EAR CANAL is well worn with the tracks of so many spiders dragging LASAGNA around.

Once inside the GUMP's skull you climb onto its brain, and place the LASAGNA between both hemispheres. You don't know what hemispheres means, you just put the LASAGNA in the crack in the brain. The brain pulsates as it always does when its processing LASAGNA. It always pulsates, it's always processing LASAGNA. Now you just have to exit through the sinuses and collect the LASAGNA that was produced when the last spider came through here.

You do that, and return to your LASAGNA PILE with your loot.
