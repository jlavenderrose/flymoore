[>Spiders and dragons fighting over lasagna.]()

Ok. THE ENDLESS VOID is filled with a finite but indeterminate numbers of SPIDERS and DRAGONS who are fighting for a finite but indeterminate amount of LASAGNA. The SPIDERS and DRAGONS appear to be equally matched, and it seems this battle might well continue forever. It is unclear if either side understands what it is they are really fighting for. It is further unclear if either side ever understood what it is they are really fighting for. Do SPIDERS and DRAGONS even know what LASAGNA is?

Should anything else be added to THE ENDLESS VOID?
