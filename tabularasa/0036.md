That sort of thing happens quite a lot. It's sort of a side effect of being in control of dark forces. You really don't mean anyone any harm, but you have at your disposal the power to bend minds and destroy nature which will sometimes put you at odds with others. Sort of.

Ruby Lee is sort of offended that you've hurt animals and plants in using your magic before. You also have hugely different viewpoints on the world. Seeing the world through its destructive potential shades how you think differently than Ruby does. Apparently you come off as strange and cryptic (you know this of course because you've read her thoughts before, nothing wrong with that).

Liam Kelly... well he's not too different really. Except he's really much more concerned with his animals, and that's his big problem with you. It's not like there have ever been any incidents between the two of you regarding animals. That would be ridiculous why would you harm his animals.

Neil Ross. Neil Ross doesn't seem to have a problem with you. Neil Ross is the 'Bard of Nil', which sounds dangerously like he might preside over some kind of dark power.

But really, those Northern Lights are beautiful, hopefully they will all understand when they get to see them for themselves.
