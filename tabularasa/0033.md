Of course there's Neil Ross. He's always been a bit of an oddball since he joined your group. He was just named the 'Bard of Nil,' whatever that means. He doesn't excel in any particular thing, he's just sort of average at just about everything, from physical strength to magics to arcane knowledge. No you take that back, he excels at arcane knowledge, throwing stuff around like what he knows about the "Icebats" all the time. 

God he can be infuriating sometimes. He's probably not particularly pleased with how you broke several of his bones in a sparring session several months ago, and then encouraged Ruby to try to mend them with magic... You've told him over and over how sorry you are about it, but it never really seems to get through to him, and he's been more antagonistic than usual since then.

Of course getting your group roped into some polar expedition is kind of ridiculous too, that isn't going to help any of you become super friendly with each other, you're sure of that.

Oh god here he comes now.
