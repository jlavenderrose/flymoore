[>stop day dreaming](0030.html)

You try to stop day dreaming, but fail because there is really nothing else to do today. All of your regular training activities have stopped, so there are no excercises to do nor classes to sit through. Tomorrow, you will start to receive information about and equipment for your trip to your assignment location, but today all you have to do is sit around. Perhaps if your parents were here you would be off with them like the rest of your group mates. 

You lose yourself in day dreaming about the North Pole again, it really sounds frigid...
