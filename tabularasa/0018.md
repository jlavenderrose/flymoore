[>be the chocolate](0017.html)

You can't be the chocolate! Instead you are a SEVENTEEN YEAR-OLD BOY. You are sitting around a campfire. Someone is telling a story.

"... and that's how our world was created."

"Bullshit," you think.

"Excuse me? I heard that you know. I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, how could we possibly have been created from some kind of tree that was cultivated by beasts we can not even fathom?"

"no. i'm thinking, how did we not get destroyed by those same unfathomable beasts?"

"Well perhaps you'll have to find that out for us then! I'll make sure to let your supervisors know for your CALL TO DUTY tomorrow. Young man, what is your name?"

What is your name?
