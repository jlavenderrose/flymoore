"YOU" are the LASAGNA. For the sake of simplicity you are a single chunk of what was once a great slab of LASAGNA held in the GREAT CASSEROLE DISH at the center of THE ENDLESS VOID. You were stolen by the SPIDERS and tossed into a mound that they guard viciously.

Nearby you can see one of the great GUMPS towering over you. This GUMP seems to have become incredibly large. There are SPIDERS crawling all over this GUMP moving in a vague sort of line. The SPIDERS start at one foot, crawl up to the head of the GUMP and actually enter one of its EARS before coming out of the other EAR and then down the other foot. It seems a very orderly system has developed here though you have no idea what it is actually for.

With your new found existence what shall you do?
