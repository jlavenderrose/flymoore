You fail to get a good night's sleep. You head back to your group's dormitory knowing that tomorrow is not going to be a good day for you. 

On your EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY you are CALLED TO DUTY. It is the way that it has been and always will be. Through a complex system of school and training and selection you are grouped into small groups of future apprentices. The Empire that makes all this happens claims that there is always a reason for the decisions that they make, that they have Seers of the Future that see your "true Duty." You don't believe any of it.

How could you, a son of scholars who never expected to be pulled into the selection process have been placed with powerful fighters, all of whom have magical powers. How could you have been selected into a group that made its way to the Capital of the World, where all the best assignments are given? You have never shown any promise in anything. All you are really good at is reading.

On your way to your dormitory you run into one of your groupmates. Ruby.

"You know you really shouldn't have done that..."
