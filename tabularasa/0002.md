Ok. THE ENDLESS VOID is filled with an ENDLESS FORREST OF GUMP. An ENDLESS FORREST of TOM HANKSES standing bolt upright looking a little bit confused. If a wind were ever to blow here the GUMPS would sway ever so slightly, creating GENTLE WAVES OF GUMP.

Should anything else be added to THE ENDLESS VOID?
