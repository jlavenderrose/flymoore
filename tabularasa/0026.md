[>never hear the end of this](0025.html)

Indeed you do never seem to hear the end of this for the rest of the day. The first people you end up talking to are you parents. They congratulate you on receiving so important a title. You ask them what makes them think a Bard of Nil is actually helpful. They respond with a useless half-answer riddle that asks what a true scholar would do as a warrior for the Empire. You can't tell if they are being snarky and sarcastic or painfully sincere.

Your friends are not tremendously better. You know Liam is being sincere when he says, "well good job 'Bard of Nil', we're going to be stuck in a frozen wasteland."

Ruby was being sarcastic when she said, "I figured out why they made you a 'Bard of Nil' Neil. Neil. Nil! It's hilarious!"

Eva seemed alright with the assignment, "it's a nice cold place to play with fire, I don't see anything wrong with that."

There was a lot to figure out, and a lot of damage to be fixed, and your group had only a week to get prepared to visit the coldest and most inhospitable places in the Empire. As you pondered this you thought, "perhaps this is all some kind of test, designed by the Empire. It's really just making sure we're up for whatever we must really do."

Perhaps.
