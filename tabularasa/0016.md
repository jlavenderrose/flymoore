You aren't even sure what that means!

However, one of the DRAGONS, succumbing to SPIDER venom and frantic, belches a fireball at the newly animated GUMP. Who knew GUMPS were so flammable! Oh the GUMPanity!

The GUMP burns, slowly destroying its body, and all the SPIDERS and DRAGONS stop in awe at the sight. Left behind is a horribly charred body, with a somehow untouched head.

Then the head explodes.

There is no gore, no splatter of blood, only a huge blast of light and suddenly there is no head anymore. In its place, planted firmly in the charred and horrific body what you would recognize as a chocolate, if you knew what chocolate was.
