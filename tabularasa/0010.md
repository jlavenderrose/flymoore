[>be the spider](0009.html)

You are the spider. You live a simple life. You are one of the many spiders tasked with feeding your GUMP. You collect LASAGNA and take it to your GUMP's brain. You don't really understand how, but somehow the LASAGNA is multiplied, and you have to collect this new LASAGNA and take it with you back to your LASAGNA PILE.

Your LASAGNA PILE is kept between smaller GUMPS. It's surrounded by webs that keep the DRAGONS away from your precious LASAGNA. You live and sleep in webs suspended between the GUMPs above your LASAGNA PILE. If any DRAGON were ever foolish enough to attack there are thousands of SPIDERS to retaliate.

No one know why they collect the LASAGNA and cultivate the GUMPS. As far as you can tell the GUMPS go on forever, and they don't do anything but get bigger and bigger. All you know is that the DRAGONS oppose what you're doing, and will stop at nothing to stop you from growing GUMPS. You aren't sure if they know why they are doing this either.

You've just woken up in your web above your LASAGNA PILE, what will you do?
