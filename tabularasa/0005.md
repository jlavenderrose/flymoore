Ok. This will take some time...

First the three DIMENSIONS OF SPACE are created. This establishes a space in THE ENDLESS VOID that allows the FORREST OF GUMP, DRAGONS, SPIDERS, and LASAGNA to exist in a coherent way. They had been compressed into a single point that comprised all of THE ENDLESS VOID.

Again, this step will take some time...

The fourth dimension, TIME, is created. This allows change to occur.

Now, the saga that should have been unfolding in the FORREST OF GUMP between the DRAGONS and SPIDERS over the LASAGNA may actually unfold. All these elements had been held in stasis as there was no way to distinguish between one state of THE ENDLESS VOID and the next.
