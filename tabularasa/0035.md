"the Northern Lights. They're this beautiful show of lights that happens in the sky when you're far enough North."

"lights? like lanterns or what?"

"No they're these ethereal, multi-colored fingers of light that spread out across the sky."

"I have no idea what that even means."

"...Look, here, they look something like this."

You run around and shutter all the windows and put out all the lights in the room to make it dark enough for your illusion to work. You then use some of your lesser magic to create an illusion of the Northern Lights.

"This really pales in comparison to what it actually looks like. The actual thing is a gigantic display of nature at work."

You stop the illusion when you realize everyone is transfixed, not because the display is so beautiful but because you used a distraction illusion to create the image.

"Sorry about that, I forget how powerful that is sometimes."

"Yes, please, don't do that again... I'm sure the Lights look beautiful but I can't even remember what I just saw."
