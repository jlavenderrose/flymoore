You are Ruby Lee. 

"Hunter of Light? What does that even mean."

You guess it makes sense though. You don't really "hunt" light, you seek it out, but the meaning is there. You've played around with this light magic quite a bit, you can do a lot of helpful things like it. You can even literally make light, which is helpful... sometimes.

Of course this all happened because today is your EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY and you got CALLED TO DUTY. Along with your group. What a group it is...

Liam Kelly is your "Slayer of Beasts," and despite his title is a sweet and caring man. You have no idea how he could hurt anyone ever. Except all the times he's obviously *accidentally* broken people's bones.

Eva Berg is your "Sorceress of Dark" which is an uncannily fitting and unsettling title. Eva seems to be your perfect counterpart, disagreeing with you in every possible way. The titles you both received make a lot of sense.

Neil Ross is, well, Neil Ross, and he is your group's "Bard of Nil." As far as you know no one has ever received that title before, and no one is really sure what it means. Neil isn't really much for music or storytelling. Nil might fit though, he doesn't seem to do all that much.
