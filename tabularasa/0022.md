This is your "Group." As part of the selection process you were matched with people who would complement your skills. You've all been together since you turned 14, and you have the scars to show it. 

Liam Kelly is the aforementioned ridiculously muscular boy. In training you were often paired with him for sparring. You are rather quick on your toes, but after having bones broken you got even faster.

Ruby Lee, a girl from rural lands, has shown promise in healing magics, but they don't always work right. Those broken bones you had? Some took a very long time to heal.

Eva Berg grew up as a fisherman's daughter in the northern seas. Spending so many nights in freezing air under the Northern Lights has managed to give her the ability to manipulate dark forces into creating fire. Together you two have destroyed lots of clothing.

Neil Ross? You can read books. You don't know why you're in this select group of powerful people. You suppose you don't mind having them as friends, but you don't really feel like you fit in.

"Well look, I'm sorry. I can't control my thoughts so well, but what's done is done. I'm going to get some sleep. Wherever we end up going, tomorrow is going to be a long day."
