[>don your spider armor](0012.html)

You quickly spin armor for yourself out of spider silk. Since you just custom made it for yourself it fits like a glove. You then realize that spider silk is extremely flammable and that these DRAGONS breathe fire. You would remove your armor but it fits like a glove and you don't have the strength to tear it.

The DRAGON is approaching! It looks like there are several following it! All the SPIDERS that haven't been fooling around making pointless armor have been making their way to your GUMP to protect it.
