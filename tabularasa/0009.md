[>spontaneously combust](0008.html)

Now this you can do! You spontaneously combust, turning yourself into charred, useless remains. As you lose your ability to perceive through this LASAGNA you see the SPIDERS crowding around you. One of them picks you up and moves you away.

The LASAGNA chunk ceases to exist. Once again there is no way to intervene in THE ENDLESS VOID or observe anything up close.

Another avatar is in order.
